:title: Mockito

link:http://mockito.org/[Mockito] is a mocking framework that: "tastes really good. It lets you write beautiful tests with clean & simple API. Mockito doesn't give you hangover because the tests are very readable and they produce clean verification errors."

I still prefer link:/tags/jmock[JMock], though.
