:title: Naked Objects

The link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects[naked objects] pattern is defined by three principles:

* All business logic should be encapsulated onto the domain objects. This principle is not unique to naked objects: it is just a strong commitment to encapsulation.

* The user interface should be a direct representation of the domain objects, with all user actions explicitly consist in the creating or the retrieving of domain objects and/or invoking methods on those objects. This principle is also not unique to naked objects: it is just a specific interpretation of an object-oriented user interface (OOUI).

* The original idea in the naked objects pattern arises from the combination of these two which form the third principle:

The user interface shall be 100% automatically created from the definition of the domain objects. This may be done using several different technologies, including source code generation; implementations of the naked objects pattern to date have favoured the technology of reflection.

The naked objects pattern was first described formally in link:http://downloads.nakedobjects.net/resources/Pawson%20thesis.pdf[Richard Pawson's PhD thesis] which includes a thorough investigation of various antecedents and inspirations for the pattern including, for example, the Morphic user interface.
