The Naked Objects distribution provides a set of Eclipse code templates to (among other things) rapidly code up properties, collections, actions and their supporting methods.  These are also listed in appendix B of the book.

If you are a user of IntelliJ IDEA then you might be interested to know that there's a project up on googlecode, [eclipse2idea](http://code.google.com/p/eclipse2idea/), that provides a utility for converting the Eclipse templates into the IntelliJ syntax.  You can then import and away you go!

Thanks to Alexander Krasnukhin, for putting that together and making it available.  We'll also make the IntelliJ templates available as part of the next Naked Objects release.
