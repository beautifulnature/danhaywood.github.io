Following on from our recent graduation as an Apache top level project and the work we've done since (new website, moving to git, adopting semantic versioning), I'm proud to announce that Isis 1.0.0 has been released.

In fact, the news is a little old by now; we https://blogs.apache.org/isis/entry/ann_apache_isis_1_0[got the release out just in time for Xmas 2012], which had always been my hope.

This first release consists of:

* Isis core 1.0.0
* Isis JDO ObjectStore 1.0.0, based on http://www.datanucleus.org/[JDO/DataNucleus] 3.1.x
* Isis File-based security 1.0.0, providing simple authentication and authorization
* Isis Wicket Viewer 1.0.0, providing a generic (naked objects) UI as a webapp, based on http://wicket.apache.org[Apache Wicket] 6.2.0
* Isis Restful Objects Viewer 1.0.0, providing a generic RESTful interface, based on http://www.jboss.org/resteasy[JBoss RestEasy] 2.3.1

More information about these on the http://isis.apache.org/documentation.html[Isis website].

In addition, we link:http://isis.apache.org/getting-started/quickstart-archetype.html[released a new Maven archetype] that combines all the above components into a single archetype. Thus, with one command, you can have a complete Isis webapp built, already integrating the Wicket or Restful viewers through to an RDBMS-based objectstore.

So, do take a moment to check it out.
