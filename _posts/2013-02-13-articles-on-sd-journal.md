I've just written a couple of articles on Apache Isis, published by the Software Developers Journal.  You can download the journal for free [here](http://sdjournal.org/software-developers-journal-open-012013-2/).

The first article is a general introduction to Apache Isis, while the second looks in detail at Isis' RESTful APIs.

To download the journal, you do need to register, but it won't cost you anything other than your email address.
