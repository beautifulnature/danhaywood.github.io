excerpt: While I'm a fan of Maven, it is true that the pom.xml files can become a little unwieldy.  Since Maven 4.0 (with long hoped-for mixins) still seems to be a way off, I decided to create some maven mixins using the maven-mixin-plugin.

While I'm generally a fan of link:http://maven.apache.org[Maven], it is true that the `pom.xml` files can become a little unwieldy.
Since Maven 4.0 (with link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-5102[long hoped-for] mixins) still seems to be a way off, I decided to create some maven mixins using Ohad David's link:https://github.com/odavid/maven-plugins/blob/master/mixin-maven-plugin/README.md[maven-mixin-plugin].

I've ended up with the following maven mixins:
