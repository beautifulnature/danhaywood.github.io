When v1.6 of [Apache Isis](http://isis.apache.org) was released a [month or two]({{ site.baseurl }}/2014/07/28/ann-apache-isis-version-1-6-0-released/) back we also announced the creation of a new ["add-ons"](http://www.isisaddons.org/) website as a place to hold reusable module of code for any Apache Isis app.

Two of the modules that we've moved into the add-ons site are for [auditing](https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit) and for [command profiling](https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command); the latter also enhances auditing capability as well as enabling Isis' background command support.

The screencast below explains how to get it configured; check out the module's respective **README**s for screenshots and more detailed discussion.

These modules should work with any Isis app, so if you're working with Isis, do check them out.
