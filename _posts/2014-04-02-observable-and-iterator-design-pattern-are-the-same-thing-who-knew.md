I've just watched [this excellent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRYN2xt11Ek) on Reactive Extensions - how they do Async Javascript at NetFlix.  A genuinely new idea for me (though I feel a bit dumb for only learning about RX now).  Worth spending the 30 mins to watch.

Also really cool that there are versions of RX not only for [Javascript](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) but also [.NET](https://rx.codeplex.com/) and [Java](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava).
