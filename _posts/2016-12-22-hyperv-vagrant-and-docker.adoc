Trying to use the https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin[Spotify maven docker] plugin led me to needing a Docker host accessible from the Windows box I use for deveopment.

An initial attempt to just use Microsoft's Windows Containers, as described link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/quick-start-windows-10[here], didn't work: although I ended up with a `docker` client, attempting to run a Centos image such as link:https://hub.docker.com/r/incodehq/tomcat/[this Tomcat image] failed.
The error I got was that Windows Containers cannot run non-Windows images.

It's possible that using regular link:https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/faqs/[Docker for Windows] (rather than Windows Containers) might work; still need to investigate that possibility.

In the meantime though I decided to go a different way and install Vagrant using Hyper-V to host a Ubuntu image, then run Docker within that Hyper-V image.

This guidance based on information in link:https://lewiswalsh.com/node-on-ubuntu-on-vagrant-on-hyperv/[this post], link:https://followkman.com/2016/07/27/vagrant-up-on-windows-10-with-hyper-v/[this post] and others.



== Install Vagrant

Download the installer from https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html[https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html], and run.


== Enable Hyper-V

Enable either through the UI:

image::https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/media/enable_role_upd.png[]

or using Powershell:

[source,powershell]
----
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
----

== Configure an External Hyper-V network switch

Open **Hyper-V Manager**, then **Virtual Switch Manager...**
  
image::images/virtual-switch-manager.png[]

Then create a new External virtual switch, eg:

image::images/external-virtual-switch.png[]


== Environment Variable

Open a Powershell session (as Administrator) in that directory, and type:

[source,cmdline]
----
$env.VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=hyperv
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER", $env.VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER, [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
----


== VagrantFile

Create a directory `c:\vagrant\machines\dockerhost`, and in that directory create this `VagrantFile`:

[source,ini]
----
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "hashicorp/precise64"
  config.vm.provider "hyperv"

  config.vm.network "public_network"

  config.vm.provider "hyperv" do |vb|
     vb.memory = "4096"
  end
  
  config.vm.provision "docker",
      images: ["ubuntu"]
end
----

== Create the Machine

Open a Powershell session (as Administrator) in that directory, and type:

[source,cmdline]
----
vagrant up
----

[source,cmdline]
----
Bringing machine 'default' up with 'hyperv' provider...
==> default: Verifying Hyper-V is enabled...
==> default: Configured startup memory is 4096
==> default: Importing a Hyper-V instance
    default: Please choose a switch to attach to your Hyper-V instance.
    default: If none of these are appropriate, please open the Hyper-V manager
    default: to create a new virtual switch.
    default:
    default: 1) nat
    default: 2) ExternalVirtualSwitch
    default:
    default: What switch would you like to use? 2
----

Select the external virtual switch created earlier.

The bootstrapping continues:

[source,cmdline]
----
    default: What switch would you like to use? 2
    default: Cloning virtual hard drive...
    default: Creating and registering the VM...
    default: Successfully imported a VM with name: precise64
==> default: Starting the machine...
==> default: Waiting for the machine to report its IP address...
    default: Timeout: 120 seconds
    default: IP: 10.0.0.25
==> default: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
    default: SSH address: 10.0.0.25:22
    default: SSH username: vagrant
    default: SSH auth method: password
    default:
    default: Inserting generated public key within guest...
    default: Removing insecure key from the guest if it's present...
    default: Key inserted! Disconnecting and reconnecting using new SSH key...
==> default: Machine booted and ready!
==> default: Preparing SMB shared folders...
    default: You will be asked for the username and password to use for the SMB
    default: folders shortly. Please use the proper username/password of your
    default: Windows account.
    default:
    default: Username: dan@haywood-associates.co.uk
    default: Password (will be hidden):
----

Enter username and password.

The bootstrapping then completes:

[source,cmdline]
----
==> default: Mounting SMB shared folders...
    default: C:/vagrant/machines/dockerhost => /vagrant
==> default: Running provisioner: docker...
    default: Installing Docker onto machine...
----


== Accessing the Machine

It should then be possible to log in:

[source,cmdline]
----
vagrant ssh
----

resulting in:

[source,cmdline]
----
Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.11.0-15-generic x86_64)

 * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/

----

You can then run docker, eg:

[source,cmdline]
----
docker version
----

resulting in:
