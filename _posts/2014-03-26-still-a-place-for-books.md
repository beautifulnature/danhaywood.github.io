Like everyone else, if I need to know how use some little API, I google for the answer and then follow the links to stackoverflow.  Yesterday my searches that took me there included an error regarding a [missing Windows Identity Foundation DLL](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10166114/unable-to-find-assembly-microsoft-identitymodel-error-on-azure), how to do [try/catch/finally in Powershell](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6779186/powershell-try-catch-finally) (just as you would've thought, by the way), and how to [change the name of a Windows service](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3887400/how-can-i-change-the-name-of-a-windows-service) (somewhat more obscure).  In fact my google history for yesterday shows I visited SO 15 times that day with different queries.

Even so, there's still a time for books.  I'm going to be starting on the next-gen viewer for [Apache Isis](http://isis.apache.org) soon, and because it's going to be written in [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org), I really think there's no substitute for immersing oneself in a book to really get into the "mindset" of that technology.

The publishers that first cornered the market in technology-specific books (at least so far as my reading was concerned) was OReilly, and then a little later I became aware of Manning.  Most recently though I've got into reading [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/), also doing an excellent job of delivering quality titles on specific technologies.  When it comes to AngularJS, for example, I see that they have [4 books](http://www.packtpub.com/books?availability%5BForthcoming%5D=Forthcoming&availability%5BAvailable%5D=Available&book_limit=20&sort=0&key=angularjs&cat_string=books%2Fall-books) currently; enough to be getting on with!   That compares to just one book on the topic from either O'Reilly or Manning.

Now I must admit that Packt do seem pretty strong on marketing, which leaves me torn.  If I were being cynical, I tend to worry that strong marketing might cover up for a weakness in material.  But as an author myself, I think I'd be appreciative that my publishing company was working hard to flog my wares!  Whatever; Packt's own surveys show almost 90% of readers are "very satisfied" with their books; that's a pretty impressive statistic.

So why this puff piece about Packt?  Well, they've just released their 2,000 book, and they've currently got a discount code which is basically a [buy-one-get-one-free](http://www.packtpub.com/news/2000book) offer.  So if you were after a book on technology X, definitely worth checking out.

Full disclosure: Oh, and yeah, I told you about their marketing department? So, apparently this post earns me an ebook or two for myself.  Well, there's a couple more of those AngularJS books I need to read, so if they help me write Isis' next-gen viewer, then it's for the greater good!
