Every year Skillsmatter run a mini-conference on domain-driven design, and [this year](http://skillsmatter.com/event/design-architecture/ddd-exchange-2012) Eric Evans asked me to do a talk on [Restful Objects](http://restfulobjects.org).

Skillsmatter recorded the talk, <!-- more -->which you can watch [here](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/design-architecture/restful-objects).
