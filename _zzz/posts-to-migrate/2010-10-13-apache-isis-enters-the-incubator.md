Really should have blogged this a while back... our [proposal](http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/IsisProposal) to donate Naked Objects framework and my sister projects to the Apache Software Foundation has been [accepted](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/201009.mbox/%3C4C85C4FE.4050104@gmail.com%3E).

We now have Mark Struberg as our champion, with Mark and also Benson Margulies, Siegfried Goeschl, James W. Carman and Vincent Massol as our nominated mentors.  Special thanks too for Mohammad Nour El-Din for his early support of our proposal and help since.

Current status: we're uploading the codebases into Subversion, which should be done by the end of this week (the naked objects code is loaded, but my sister projects are still to go).

In the meantime we've been figuring out how we want to restructure some of the existing code, bearing in mind our objective to use [JSR-299](http://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/1.0.1-Final/en-US/pdf/weld-reference.pdf) in the future and trying to make the architecture of the framework easy to understand for a contributors.  You can see the results of our current thinking on the [Isis wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ISIS/MavenModules).

And, if you're interested in monitoring our progress or getting involved, then our [mailing list](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-isis-dev/) is a good place to [subscribe](mailto:isis-dev-subscribe@incubator.apache.org).
