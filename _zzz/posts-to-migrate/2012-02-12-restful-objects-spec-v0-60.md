Work continues on the [Restful Objects](http://restfulobjects.org) spec, which aims to define a set of RESTful resources, and corresponding
representations, for accessing and manipulating a domain object model.




Recent significant changes include a full description of how to use view models to encapsulate the domain entities while preserving the RESTful HATEOAS principle, and support support for blobs/clobs, in other words media types such as application/pdf, image/jpeg etc.




Feedback always welcome.
