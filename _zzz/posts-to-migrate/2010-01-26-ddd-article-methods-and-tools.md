If you've just stumbled across this blog and are wondering what "domain driven design" is all about, you might like to check out an article I wrote for the Methods and Tools journal.  It's [downloadable](http://www.methodsandtools.com/mt/download.php?winter09) in their (free) PDF magazine, and is also available [online in HTML form](http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=97).

Thanks to Vaughn Vernon for his time reviewing it... but any mistakes and errors are mine alone!
