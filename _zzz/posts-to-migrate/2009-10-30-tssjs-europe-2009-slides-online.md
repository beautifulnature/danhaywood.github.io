Just had an enjoyable few days at the TSS Java Symposium conference in Prague.  Never been to Prague before - like everyone told me, a very beautiful city.

At the conference itself also met some very interesting people and there were some interesting sessions - I intend to blog more fully about it in the next few days.

In the meantime, if you're interested in seeing my presentation, it's been [uploaded](http://www.slideshare.net/javasymposium/dan-haywood-presentation) (along with all the others) .  Seemed to be well enough received and I was happy with the size of audience (my elevator pitch is improving!).  There was rather too much content for an hour, though... it definitely lived up to the session title of being "a whistlestop tour".
