When I teach my [little]({{ site.baseurl }}/2011/12/20/db-unit-testing-with-dbunit-json-hsqldb-and-junit-rules/) [Java]({{ site.baseurl }}/2011/12/17/jmock-2-6-junit-rules-and-automocking-using-an-mock-annotation/) [TDD]({{ site.baseurl }}/2010/11/04/contract-test-for-value-types/) course, I quite often do live coding demos ...especially if we're running behind schedule and I want to catch up; I'll skip an exercise and work through the solution.  And one of the remarks I often get at the end is "thanks for the course, but what I also found useful was learning about how to use Eclipse effectively".

Well, I guess I have used Eclipse for over 10 years now, so I suppose I am reasonably familiar with it.  So I thought I'd show some of these tips by way of a series of screencasts.

The first one in the series is nice and simple: the "Extract Local Variable" refactoring, and its corollary, "Inline Variable"; something I use an awful lot when working on [Apache Isis](http://isis.apache.org) codebase.  You'll find it just below...
