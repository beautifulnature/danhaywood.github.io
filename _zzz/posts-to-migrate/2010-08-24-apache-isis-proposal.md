Over the last few months we've been seriously considering donating both the original Naked Objects framework as well as my sister projects to the Apache Software Foundation, sounding out various people and gauging interest.  Today we formally announced a proposal for a new project to be accepted into the Apache incubator.  The name we're proposing for this combined project is Apache Isis.

The rationale is to develop Isis into a standards-based framework for building domain-driven apps, appealing both to its user community (who just want to use it "out-of-the-box") and to its contributor community (who want to quickly understand how it works and what is required to extend it).  Ultimately it's about securing the future of the framework to allow more people to realize the benefits of domain-driven applications when developed using the naked objects pattern.

You can read the full proposal at: [http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/IsisProposal](http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/IsisProposal).  If you like what you see, then why not get involved.  And if you don't, tell us why so we can address it.
