Following on from [Isis' recent graduation]({{ site.baseurl }}/2013/01/12/apache-isis-graduates-as-a-top-level-apache-project-gets-a-new-website/) as an Apache top-level project, the Isis community also voted to move our codebase over from Subversion and into Git.  That's not to say that Subversion is a bad SCM - far from it - but Git has a number of advantages over it, not least the fact that Git makes it easier for users to contribute back patches.  This is helped in no small part by the fact that ASF mirrors the code into github; you can find Isis' codebase at [http://github.com/apache/isis](http://github.com/apache/isis).

You can find details on how to get started with Isis and git at our website; you'll even find [a nice page](http://isis.apache.org/contributors/contributing.html) (with pictures!) that describes the process, and a crib sheet for all the [useful git commands](http://isis.apache.org/contributors/git-cookbook.html) to use to contribute back changes.  Check it out!
