Hmm, it's high time I did another post, so this one's just to mention that I'm going to be attending the [Apache Code Retreat](http://sites.google.com/site/apacheretreatknockree/) this weekend, looking forward to meeting face-to-face some of the other [Apache Isis](http://incubator.apache.org/isis) committers for the first time.  The retreat also includes an open-to-all unconference on the Saturday.

Also hoping to get a little guidance on how to put out a release formally.  It's high time that we released a first version of Isis from the incubator.  I've been working steadily on the codebase and supporting documentation, as well as an [archetype](http://incubator.apache.org/isis/quickstart-app.html) to get you started quickly.  Next step is to get a release into the central Maven repo so that it's easily accessible by all.

I'll let you know how I get on.
