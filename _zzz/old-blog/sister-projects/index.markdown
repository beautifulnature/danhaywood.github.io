Naked Objects framework is an extensible component-based framework.  So over the last couple of years, as well as contributing heavily to Naked Objects itself, I've factored a number of additional contributions into a number of sister projects, collectively known as "star objects" (*objects, geddit?).

Three of these are mentioned in the book:



	
  * [Tested Objects](http://testedobjects.sourceforge.net), which integrates Naked Objects with FitNesse so that it can be tested using end-user scenario tests.

	
  * [RESTful Objects](http://restfulobjects.sourceforge.net), which provides a RESTful API to a Naked Objects

	
  * [JPA Objects](http://jpaobjects.sourceforge.net), which reworks the Hibernate object store using JPA annotations.


Look out for blogs on these topics.
