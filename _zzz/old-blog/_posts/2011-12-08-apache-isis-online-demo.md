[![Apache Isis Online Demo screenshot](http://danhaywood.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/apacheisisonlinedemoscreenshot.png?w=150)](http://mmyco.co.uk:8180/isis-onlinedemo/)We've finally got around to putting together an online demo of [Apache Isis](http://incubator.apache.org/isis) for would-be users to quickly grok what Isis is all about. If you don't fancy reading any further but just want to play, you can find it [here](http://mmyco.co.uk:8180/isis-onlinedemo/).
<!-- more -->

If you're still with me, you'll find that the online demo shows how Isis can dynamically generate a (human-usable) webapp and a (machine-usable) RESTful API from the same domain object model. The REST API is that
defined by the [Restful Objects](http://restfulobjects.org) spec.

The online demo bundles its own documentation, which shows the full source code for the domain model (all 3 classes) along with guidance on how to use Chrome (or similar) extensions to play with the REST API directly from your browser.

Feedback very welcome on the [isis-dev](mailto:isis-dev@incubator.apache.org) mailing list.
