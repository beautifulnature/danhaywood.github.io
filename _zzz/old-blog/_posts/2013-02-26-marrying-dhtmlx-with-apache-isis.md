Mylaensys have just publicised on their [blog](http://blog.mylaensys.com/2013/02/about-apache-isis.html) the fact that they are working on an integration between [DHTMLX](http://dhtmlx.com/) and [Apache Isis](http://isis.apache.org). 

They previously have integrated DHTMLX and Spring Framework ([DHTMLX Spring Link](http://www.mylaensys.com/dhtmlx-spring-integration.html)), so they have a proven track record... and I've been impressed how quickly they've produced some early prototypes.

So if the idea of rapidly building domain-driven apps with a customizable UI appeals, then keep an eye on their progress.  The [Isis mailing lists](http://isis.apache.org/support.html) would be a good place to subscribe :-)
