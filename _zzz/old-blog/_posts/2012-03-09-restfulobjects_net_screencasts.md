For those interested in the work I've been doing on [Restful Objects](http://restfulobjects.org), you might be interested to see that Richard Pawson has recorded some screencasts on the [.NET implementation](http://restfulobjects.codeplex.com) of Restful Objects.

I've linked to them from the [Restful Objects website](http://restfulobjects.org/screencasts/).

The [Apache Isis](http://incubator.apache.org/isis) impl of Restful Objects currently lags behind the .NET impl, though not too far behind.  Check out [Isis' online demo](http://mmyco.co.uk:8180/isis-onlinedemo) to see the current state.
