In my book I focus on the open source Java version of Naked Objects, but (as I briefly mention) there is also a commercial version of Naked Objects that runs on .NET. This is developed by Richard Pawson's company, Richard being the originator of the Naked Objects pattern; (Richard and I continue to work closely together over in [Ireland](http://www.nakedobjects.net/resources/dsfa_case_study.shtml), but that's a different story).

Anyway... Richard and his team have been working on a new web-based viewer for Naked Objects.NET, running on top of ASP.NET MVC. Naturally enough, he's called it Naked Objects MVC.

Like my own [Wicket Objects viewer]({{ site.baseurl }}/2010/06/28/wicket-objects-v0-1-give-it-a-tryood-enough-to-try-out/), Naked Objects MVC provides a full webapp from just a domain object model, but then allows the GUI to be customized in a variety of ways.

So, if you're a .NET developer, do check it out. Richard's put together some videos on his [website](http://www.nakedobjects.net) so you can quickly assess if it's for you:
