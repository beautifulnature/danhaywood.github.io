As I blogged about in [previously]({{ site.baseurl }}/2009/08/29/using-the-naked-objects-4-0-maven-archetype/), Naked Objects is available from the Maven central repository.  But to get you started there's also a download available from the [project website on Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nakedobjects/) which provides some example applications and other resources.

In this screencast I show you how to import and then run one of these example applications in Eclipse, and I go through the other resources available.
