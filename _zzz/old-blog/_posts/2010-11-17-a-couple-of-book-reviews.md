About my book "Domain Driven Design using Naked Objects", that is...



	
  * the [first review](http://www.i-programmer.info/bookreviews/4-methodology/1558-domain-driven-design-using-naked-objects-.html) is on [I-Programmer Info](http://www.i-programmer.info/), not a site I frequent, but which calls itself an "online magazine for programmers".  The material there looks ok, actually, if a little heavy on the adverts

        
  * the [second review](http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=conWebDoc.37509) is on the [BCS](http://www.bcs.org) (Chartered Institute for IT) website.  I've been a member of the BCS for many years, and there are lots of good specialist and regional groups here in the UK


If you're wondering whether to buy the book then they're worth a quick skim.
