In a few weeks time [theserverside](http://theserverside.com) will be running their Java Symposium conference in Prague.



I'm pleased to say I'll be doing a [session](http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/html/frameworks.html#DHaywoodNakedOb) there, providing a whistlestop tour to the various features available in Naked Objects 4.0.Â  If you can make it, why not drop in and introduce yourself.
