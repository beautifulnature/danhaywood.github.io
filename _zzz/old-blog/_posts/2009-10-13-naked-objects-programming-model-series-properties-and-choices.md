Naked Objects excels as a rapid prototyping environment.  However, many rapid prototyping environments focus on user interface details, and gloss over the underlying domain concepts that sit underneath.  With Naked Objects though (because the UI is generated automatically from the domain model), when we do rapid development prototyping we are prototyping the domain model itself.

This post is the first in a series of screencasts showing how to code using the Naked Objects programming model.  In it we build upon the [example claims application]({{ site.baseurl }}/2009/09/17/naked-objects-example-claims-app-and-other-resources/) and show how to add a property to a domain object, and provide a list of choices (a drop-down list) for that property.
