I've just uploaded an update - v0.47 - to the Restful Objects spec, which you can download from [http://restfulobjects.org](http://restfulobjects.org).

Noteworthy changes in this version include:



	
  * restructured the first few chapters, in particular explicitly addressing how RO spec allows client/server to evolve separately, and refining the previous discussion about resources that represent private state vs those that represent shared state

	
  * separated out Restful Objects' use of existing standards vs its use of custom query parameters and standard json-properties in its representations

	
  * moved the chapters defining the domain object representations into the chapters that define the domain object resources; the hope is that it makes the document easier to follow

	
  * added a new "Error" representation


As ever, any constructive feedback is welcomed.
