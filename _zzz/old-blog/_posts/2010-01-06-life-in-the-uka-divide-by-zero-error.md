One of the things I like once Christmas is over is to read those end-of-year reviews and stories in magazines and newspapers (happy new year, by the way).

Here was a story that I read in "[The Week](http://www.theweek.co.uk/)" that made me laugh.  But it's also is a pretty fair reflection of what it's like to live in the UK in 2010:

A doctor's surgery in Lancashire was docked Â£375 because it hadn't received any complaints.  Under the current NHS system, surgeries are rewarded for hitting targets, one of which is how well they deal with complaints.  Since the surgery received none, it lost out.

I guess that's a divide by zero error of some sort?
