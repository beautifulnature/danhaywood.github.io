Here in the UK we have the ability to [petition](http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/ITProcessReview/) our prime minister.  So [Rob Bowley](http://blog.robbowley.net/2010/02/02/sign-my-petition-to-the-pm-to-demand-the-uk-govt-reviews-its-failed-it-processes/) has set up an e-petition asking the government to review how IT systems are procured.  In essence:  please stop wasting money using waterfall development processes; use agile instead.

So, if you are a UK citizen, please consider signing.  And pass on the message.  Eventually it might save us all some tax.
