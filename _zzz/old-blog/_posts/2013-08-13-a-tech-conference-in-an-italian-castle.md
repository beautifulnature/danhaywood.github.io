The first week in October I'll be trogging off to do a talk at a new tech conference with a little bit of a difference... it's in a castle, by the Med.  The conference is the [MedIT Symposium](http://www.medit-symposium.com/), to be held at the Castle of Milazzo, in Sicily.

The [schedule](http://www.medit-symposium.com/schedule-day-one.html) [is](http://www.medit-symposium.com/schedule-day-two.html) heavy on open source technologies, with an emphasis on the leading edge.  Mobile and cloud get substantial coverage, so too do DSLs as do RAD frameworks such as [Apache Isis](http://isis.apache.org) and [OpenXava](http://openxava.org/).

For myself, I'm interested in learning a bit more about OpenXava, and I'm also interested in the [XText](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) ... we've been thinking about writing a DSL for Apache Isis, and we reckon XText would be a good fit.

But - as you'll see from a peruse of the schedule - other technologies being covered include [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/), [Gaelyk](http://gaelyk.appspot.com/), [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/), [Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch), [JOOQ](http://www.jooq.org/), [Mixare](http://www.mixare.org/), [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/platform/titanium-platform/), [ownCloud](http://owncloud.org/) ... something for most everyone!

Anyway, check it out as something a little different to round off your summer.
