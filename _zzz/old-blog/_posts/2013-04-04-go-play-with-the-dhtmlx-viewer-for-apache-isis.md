Mylaensys (Madytyoo and chums) have [just blogged](http://blog.mylaensys.com/2013/04/isis-viewer-dhtmlx-preview.html) about their viewer for [Apache Isis](http://isis.apache.org) based on the [DHTMLX Javascript widget library](http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxSuite/index.shtml).

The post provides a bunch of tech details along points to a simple example you can [play with running on Google App Engine](http://isis-viewer-dhtmlx.appspot.com/).  Here's a quick screenshot:

Apart from looking rather pleasant, what's notable about this viewer is the fact that it supports a DSL allowing the UI to be easily customized.  Thanks must go to Marcius Brand√£o and colleagues for their prior work on a [Naked Objects view language](http://www.slideshare.net/marciusbrandao/naked-objects-view-languageinfo-brasil) (and as implemented in their NO framework, [Entities](http://www.slideshare.net/marciusbrandao/framwork-entities)) for originall developing this idea.

Anyway, do check this new viewer out; I'll pass on any feedback I get to Mylaensys.
