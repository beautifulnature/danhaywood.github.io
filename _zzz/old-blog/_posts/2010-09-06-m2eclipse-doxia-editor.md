Just rebuilding Eclipse and thought I'd upgrade to the latest version of [m2eclipse](http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org).  However, it would seem like the latest version has dropped support for the Doxia editor (used for editing APT files), at least while they get ready for a v1.0 release (see this [forum posting](http://maven.40175.n5.nabble.com/doxia-editor-installation-not-available-at-update-dev-td139984.html) from Jason van Zyl).

However, all is not lost, because the Doxia editor is available from an archived update site, [http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/archives/0.9.9.200909092308/](http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/archives/0.9.9.200909092308/).  And it installs just fine in Eclipse Helios, with a later version of m2eclipse already installed: <!-- more -->
