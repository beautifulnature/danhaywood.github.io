In Naked Objects every domain object should have an icon (otherwise a default icon is used). It's just about the only overtly GUI-related piece of configuration that is required.

The Naked Objects Framework itself has a stock of pretty good icons, but I'm always on the lookout for new icons either open source or relatively inexpensive. Here's a couple:

  * Open source, freely usable under Creative Commons license: [http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library)
  * Commercial, but $50 or less: [http://www.ndesign-studio.com/stock-icons](http://www.ndesign-studio.com/stock-icons)

If you know of any others, let me know!
