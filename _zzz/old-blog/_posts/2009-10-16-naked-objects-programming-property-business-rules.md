In the [first post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2009/10/13/naked-objects-programming-model-series-properties-and-choices/) in this series, we saw how to add a new property to a domain object and specify some choices.

One of the aims of Naked Objects is to ensure that our domain objects are behaviourally-complete: that they encapsulate a coherent set of responsibilities.  Not anaemic domain models, but OO like your mother taught you.

So in this screencast <!-- more --> we extend the example to add in various validation business rules for a property.  We also specify whether the property is enabled, and even if it is [visible]({{ site.baseurl }}/2009/08/19/see-it-use-it-do-it/).
